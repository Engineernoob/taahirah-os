## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with Web Audio API support
- Local web server (for optimal performance)

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Serve the files using a local web server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8000

   # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server

   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/pinball.html`

### Integration with Portfolio
The game is designed to integrate seamlessly into portfolio websites:

1. **Direct Link**: Link directly to `pinball.html`
2. **Embedded**: Include the game in an iframe within your portfolio
3. **Responsive**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes

## üéØ Game Mechanics

### Scoring System
- **Bumpers**: 100-200 points each
- **Targets**: 300 points each
- **Ramps**: 500 points each
- **Flippers**: 10 points per hit
- **Multiball**: 2x score multiplier

### Special Modes
- **Multiball**: Triggered by hitting high-value bumpers or all targets
- **Combo Multiplier**: Consecutive hits increase score multiplier
- **Ball Management**: Up to 3 balls per game

### Physics Parameters
- **Gravity**: 0.3 units per frame
- **Friction**: 0.98 (2% energy loss per frame)
- **Bounce Damping**: 0.8 (20% energy loss on collision)
- **Flipper Force**: 0.5 units of acceleration

## üé® Customization

### Visual Theme
The game uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #00ff88;
  --secondary-color: #ff6b35;
  --background-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #000428 0%, #004e92 100%);
  --accent-glow: rgba(0, 255, 136, 0.5);
}
```

### Game Balance
Adjust game difficulty by modifying physics constants in `pinball.js`:

```javascript
// Easy mode
this.gravity = 0.2;
this.friction = 0.99;

// Hard mode
this.gravity = 0.4;
this.friction = 0.97;
```
